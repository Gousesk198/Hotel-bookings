# Conclusion

* The City hotel receives around 60% of bookings, making it busier than the Resort hotel. Both hotels have higher booking cancellation rates, but the City hotel has a lower rate of returning guests. The overall average daily rate (adr) of the City hotel is slightly higher than the Resort hotel.

* Most guests stay for less than 5 days in a hotel, while the Resort hotel is preferred for longer stays.

* Both hotels experience high booking cancellation rates, with few guests returning for another booking at the City hotel. The majority of guests come from European countries, with Portugal being the most common country of origin. The TA/TO channel is the most popular way for guests to make bookings, although a high percentage of bookings made through this channel are cancelled.

* GDS channel provides higher adr deals for hotels, so increasing popularity on this channel can benefit hotels.

* July-August are the busiest and most profitable months for both hotels. Within a month, the adr gradually increases as the month ends, with a small sudden rise on weekends.

* Couples are the most common type of guests, and their needs can be catered to in order to increase revenue. Larger groups of guests tend to make more special requests.

* Bookings made through complementary market segments and for adults have a higher average number of special requests.

* Generally, longer stays (more than 15 days) can result in better deals in terms of lower adr. Not getting the same reserved room, longer lead times, and waiting times do not significantly affect booking cancellations, but a different room allotment can lower the adr.
