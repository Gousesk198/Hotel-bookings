The dataset includes data on customers from different countries, who have made their bookings through travel agents or tourism agencies. Some of the key variables that have been collected include the length of the customer's stay, the month in which the booking was made, and the category of room that was assigned to the customer upon arrival. Additionally, the dataset provides information on when the booking was made, whether it was made on a weekday or weekend, and what category of food the customer ordered during their stay.\n",

Lastly, to enhance the dataset, we added important columns like total people and total stay as there was no particular column for total bookings and stay.
